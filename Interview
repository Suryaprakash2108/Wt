Cloud computing provides scalability by allowing applications to increase or decrease resources, such as compute power or storage, as needed to handle varying workloads. Elasticity ensures that these resources can be automatically adjusted in real-time, ensuring efficient performance during demand spikes and cost savings during low usage periods.
